### Updates

There have hardly been much updates to pdf2cbt ever since I joined college due to their 85% attendance criteria, homeworks, projects/courses etc.

Now I have semester end exams from 13th Jan onwards till 2nd week of Feb which means I won't be able to work again in this period.

I currently have Study Holidays until 13th Jan and so I have time to work on pdf2cbt now, I will working on this project from 6th to 10th of Jan so expect some updates.

### Upcoming features

1. Add an ```Instructions panel``` to the ```Test Interface```, similar to real exams, showing marking schemes, rules, and other information. This will not only make it feel more like the real exam but also for exam formats like JEE Advanced where question rules/instructions varies. For example, there are sections which say that answer should be an integer from 0 to 9.
 - This feature will be achieved through templates with placeholder variables inside it that will be replaced with actual data (total questions, correct marks, max marks, incorrect marks, questions type, etc).
 - We can choose the template (or create a custom one) after the PDF Croppering process (but before generating test zip). As the ```PDF Cropper``` page won't be just about PDF Cropper, I will be renaming it to ```Test Maker``` page with PDF Cropper, instruction adder etc in it. Naming it to ```Test Maker``` will also make it easy for new users to understand what it is for.

2. Add a ```Shuffle Questions``` button inside the ```Test Interface``` to shuffle questions within their respective sections.

### A subreddit for PDF2CBT

As asked by some, I have made a subreddit, [r/PDF2CBT](https://www.reddit.com/r/PDF2CBT/).

This is a subreddit for discussing, sharing, and helping each other with PDF2CBT.

I will also be sharing features I will/am working on so that I can let you all know and get some opinion/feedback during development of that feature
