### Upcoming features

1. I am currently working on a feature in the Pattern-Based Cropper that records the steps the cropper takes while searching for, deciding on, and cropping questions. Using this recorded data, we will be able to preview the step-by-step actions in the UI, with speed control, to see exactly how the cropper processes each question. This will help us understand how the cropper works and why it fails to find or crop a question when it is expected to do so.


I have postponed **Shuffle Questions** feature that was planned to be added in Test Interface. This feature is postponed so that it can be implemented alongside support for UGEE (multiple section groups, i.e., SUPR & REAP) and BITSAT (bonus section), since all of these features require modifications to the data structures of the Test Interface and Results pages.

### A subreddit for PDF2CBT

As asked by some, I have made a subreddit, [r/PDF2CBT](https://www.reddit.com/r/PDF2CBT/).

This is a subreddit for discussing, sharing, and helping each other with PDF2CBT.

I will also be sharing features I will/am working on so that I can let you all know and get some opinion/feedback during development of that feature
